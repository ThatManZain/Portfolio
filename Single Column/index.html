        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
      The Italian GP racetrack is called Autodromo Nazionale di Monza. The track is a historic one, that has changed throughout the years, and only has a total of eleven turns. It is a very high-speed circuit, so Formula One teams have to find the right balance to where the car is overall efficient, as well fast in a straight line. Qualifying results showed Charles Leclerc on pole (first) for the race start, then George Russel, follewed by Lando Norris in third. 
     <h2>The Race</h2>
      
      As the race went under way, Max Verstappen, the championship leader (who started in 7th place due to engine penalties) very quickly drove through the field and go up to P2, behind Leclerc. Charles Leclerc drives for Ferrari, who've had some excellent moments in the early part of the season, but eventually, Max Verstappen (who drives for Red Bull) caught up and passed Leclerc in the championship standings. Leclerc came in to the pits for his mandatory stop a bit earlier than probably most expected, and Max took the lead. Later on, Max and his Red Bull's pace seemed so strong, and he ended up taking the win, and Leclerc could not put up the fight. Crowd reactions were said to be containing booes and probably a lot of disspointment as the Italian GP is basically Ferrari's home game. THe final results were: Max Verstappen first with Red Bull, Leclerc second for Ferrari, and George Russel with third place for Mercedes. On a more positive note, Formula E driver Nyck DeVries came in to drive as a substitute for one of the drivers of the team Williams, and he not only out performed his teammate on debut, but he even scored some points, finishing in an impressive 9th place.
