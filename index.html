<p>So let me talk about my favorite team, Scuderia Ferrari. Ferrari is a historic car company that has made epic roadcars that people seem to love. But Ferrari is also the most successful Formula 1 team in history. They have had many amazing wins with legendary drivers such as Michael Schumacher, Alain Prost, and Charles Leclerc. And since there hasn't been another Ferrari or F1 GIF in a while, here are some more:</p>

<h1>Which Teams Can Beat Ferrari?</h1>
<p>None of them! No I'm just kidding. Ferrari hasn't actually won a champinship since 2007. They have had very skilled drivers since then, but no championship as of yet. There are several problems that I think should be addressed. Firstly, strategicallly the team hasn't seemed strong in 2022 at least. Their decsion-making at times has not looked as strong as their rivals at RedBull. Secondly, mechanical issues were another problem that would arise in 2022. For example, Charles Leclerc was performing well in Spain, and a reliabilty issue occured, and he had to retire. Same thing happened in Baku. Both Ferrari drivers failed to finish the race. In Austria as well, Carlos Sainz's Ferrari did not finish the race again. Thirdly, I think when you're up against a strong team like RedBull, once one of your two drivers starts to rival him to a point where a championship win is possible, that driver should be prioritized over the other driver. Because if you let both drivers fight on track, they could simply just slow each other down and lose ground to their rival teams, and unneccesary collisions can occur. And once again, here are more GIFs.</p>
